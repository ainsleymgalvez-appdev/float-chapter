# A right triangle's two shorter sides have length 2.8 and 4.5. How long is its longest side?
# Check the pythagorous.png file for the Pythagorean Theorem
# 
# Your output should be a number; for example,
# 
# 5.3

side_1 = 2.8
side_2 = 4.5
# side 3 = ????

x = ((2.8)**2) + ((4.5)**2)

side_3 = x ** 0.5
